# My-First-Github-Test
This is a beginning of my GitHub practice when I'm in military

<br>December 6th, 2022</br>
<br>I started to begin Github because I did not want to waste my time in my military. For example, after night roll call, we have some time (approx. 2 hours) to relax before we go bed, we can either watch TV, chat with co-workers or time to study. And now I want to spend some time on Studying. So I have decided to start my github diary. </br>
<br>Starting today I might get into Github Frequently (maybe not everyday due to lack of time here), and design my github website and show my study progress with JAVA.</br>
<br>I have just begun to study JAVA language, because I need to prepare for my college courses after I discharge (approx. 9 months left). And I have a strong feeling that I am so behind that I might not be able to catch back if I don't study now.</br>
<br>So I made a little progress before I decided to make my github account, that I have achieved AWS Cloud Practitioner Certificate.</br>
<br>Now I will learn how to design my webpage and move on to the next stage.</br>


<br>Good Luck, Hunter.</br>
