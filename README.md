# My-First-Github-Test
This is a beginning of my GitHub practice when I'm in military

<br><span style = " font-size:1.5em;  color: green;">December 6th, 2022</span></br>
<br>I started to begin Github because I did not want to waste my time in my military. For example, after night roll call, we have some time (approx. 2 hours) to relax before we go bed, we can either watch TV, chat with co-workers or time to study. And now I want to spend some time on Studying. So I have decided to start my github diary. </br>
<br>Starting today I might get into Github Frequently (maybe not everyday due to lack of time here), and design my github website and show my study progress with JAVA.</br>
<br>I have just begun to study JAVA language, because I need to prepare for my college courses after I discharge (approx. 9 months left). And I have a strong feeling that I am so behind that I might not be able to catch back if I don't study now.</br>
<br>So I made a little progress before I decided to make my github account, that I have achieved AWS Cloud Practitioner Certificate.</br>
<br>Now I will learn how to design my webpage and move on to the next stage.</br>

Today I created My GitPod Project to practice JAVA language.

I wanted to use <i>Eclipse</i>, <i>VSCode</i> or other applications, but CIKR(Cyber Knowledge Information Room, aka Military PC Room) must login to use their PC, so it is impossible to download any packages to install because it gets deleted after I logout.

<br>Good Luck, Hunter.</br>
